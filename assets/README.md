# <Module-3-Password-Generator>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?

    This is the first project that uses Javascript so it tested my ability to string together code and know where to look for what answers i need.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")

    This project is living proof that Javascript is doing work on the website. A simple prompt should not be used but as a starter project it helps so the limitless possibilities of Javascript. The usefullness of a password generator is also extremely useful.

- What problem does it solve?

    Its a password generator. It allows you to think about what your passwords are on several sites and encourages you to use this to make new passwords for things you care about.

- What did you learn?

    I learned the simple beginning commands of Javascript and what the use is of said codes. I learned how to bring this code to life as well as to link it to former subjects such as html and how to negate the use of css by using javascript (though i didnt specifically learn that in this project).
